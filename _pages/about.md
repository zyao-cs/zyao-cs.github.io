I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University, Denmark, under the supervision of Prof. [Yan Zhao](https://yan20191113.github.io/). I closely collaborate with Prof. [Christian S. Jensen](https://csj.cs.aau.dk/), Associate Prof. [Tianyi Li](http://tianyili.site/), and Prof. [Kristian Torp](https://vbn.aau.dk/da/persons/torp/). I received my Ph.D. degree from Northeastern University in 2025 under the supervision of Prof. [Junchang Xin](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/xinjunchang/zh_CN/index.htm). From 2022 to 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Aalborg University, hosted by Associate Prof. [Tianyi Li](http://tianyili.site/).
